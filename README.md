- ðŸ“« How to reach me: *thameemhadhi@gmail.com*
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on *Electronics & Verilog Projects*
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for *Internships, Fellowships & Research opportunities on Digital Electronics*


In this bustling, sceptical, altruistic, neurotic, prosaic world, I am an ambitious and self-driven upcoming young professional currently doing B. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Government Engineering College Thrissur under APJ KTU University, Kerala

Taking up Electronics and Communication was like walking down the alley in search of my dreams and passion. It would be totally true to say that what I chose has opened innumerous doors of opportunities for me. Formulating my plans to work hard for a career in VLSI and Embedded Systems was something that came out of pondering over my favourite subjects in electronics. Gaining industrial expertise and diving deep into these indulging concepts are some of my topmost priorities as of now. Immersing myself, exploring this mesmerising world of digital electronics have paved a beautiful way for me to be zestful and self-content.

I am also an experienced Digital Content Creator with a demonstrated history of working in the non-profit organization management industry. Skilled in Leadership, Communication and Team Building. A dabbler in 3D designing and an amateur in graphic designing.
